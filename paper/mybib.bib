                   composing a programming language by combining
                   action-semantics modules. Each module is
                   defined separately, and then a new module is
                   defined by either extending or combining
                   existing modules. This method enables the
                   language designer to gradually develop a
                   language by selecting, extending and combining
                   suitable language modules. The resulting
                   modular structure is substantially different
                   from that previously employed in
                   action-semantic descriptions.

                   We also discuss how to resolve the conflicts
                   that may arise when combining modules, and
                   indicate some advantages that action semantics
                   has over other approaches in this respect."
